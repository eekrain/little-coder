/**
 * Resolve the Write tool's `file_path` argument to a concrete on-disk path.
 *
 * Two deterministic rewrites:
 *
 * 1. `"/<single-segment>"` (e.g. `/foo.md`) → `<cwd>/<single-segment>`.
 *    Background: the model has been seen to anchor at filesystem root when
 *    given an "Absolute file path" schema and no obvious directory context.
 *    Genuine system-path writes always include at least one intermediate
 *    directory (`/etc/X`, `/tmp/Y/Z`), so a root + bare filename is almost
 *    always a mistake. Rewriting to cwd matches user intent and avoids
 *    accidentally writing to `/`.
 *
 * 2. Bare filename / relative path (no leading slash) → resolved against cwd.
 *    Node's `fs` APIs already do this implicitly, but resolving here makes
 *    the success message report the real absolute path that was written.
 *
 * Anything else (absolute path with at least one intermediate directory) is
 * left untouched.
